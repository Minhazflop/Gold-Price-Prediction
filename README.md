# Gold Price Prediction using Random Forest Regressor

This project demonstrates the implementation of a **Random Forest Regressor** to predict gold prices based on historical financial data. The dataset includes various financial indicators such as stock prices, oil prices, silver prices, and currency exchange rates, which are used to train the model and predict future gold prices.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict gold prices using a Random Forest Regressor, a powerful ensemble machine learning algorithm. The project includes data exploration, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization of actual vs. predicted gold prices.

Key steps include:
- Loading and exploring the dataset.
- Analyzing correlations between features.
- Splitting data into training and testing sets.
- Training a Random Forest Regressor model.
- Evaluating model performance using metrics.
- Visualizing the actual vs. predicted gold prices.

---

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is `gld_price_data.csv`, which contains the following columns:
- **Date**: The date of the observation.
- **SPX**: S&P 500 stock index.
- **GLD**: Gold price (target variable).
- **USO**: United States Oil Fund price.
- **SLV**: Silver price.
- **EUR/USD**: Euro to US Dollar exchange rate.

### Dataset Summary
- **Number of rows**: 2,290
- **Number of columns**: 6
- **Missing Values**: None (confirmed via `isnull().sum()`)

## Installation
To run this project, ensure you have Python installed along with the required libraries. Follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd gold-price-prediction
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset (`gld_price_data.csv`) is placed in the appropriate directory (`C:/dataset/` or update the path in the code).
2. Open the Jupyter notebook (`gold_price_prediction.ipynb`) in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
3. Run all cells to execute the analysis, model training, and visualization.
4. Review the results and visualizations to understand the model's performance.

---

## Data Preprocessing
The following preprocessing steps were performed:
1. Loaded the dataset using `pandas`.
2. Explored the dataset using `head()`, `tail()`, `shape`, `info()`, `describe()`, and `isnull().sum()` to understand its structure and confirm no missing values.
3. Calculated the correlation matrix using `corr()` to analyze relationships between features.
4. Visualized the correlation matrix using a heatmap (`seaborn` and `matplotlib`).

---

## Model Training
The Random Forest Regressor model was trained as follows:
1. **Feature Selection**: The features (`SPX`, `USO`, `SLV`, `EUR/USD`) were used to predict the target variable (`GLD`).
2. **Data Splitting**: The dataset was split into training and testing sets using `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection`.
3. **Model Training**: A `RandomForestRegressor` from `sklearn.ensemble` was trained on the training data.
4. **Prediction**: Predictions were made on the test data.

---

## Results
The model's performance was evaluated using standard regression metrics from `sklearn.metrics`. The key metrics include:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R-squared Score (R²)

These metrics help assess the accuracy and reliability of the model in predicting gold prices. *(Note: Specific metric values are not included in the notebook snippet provided; update this section with actual results after running the evaluation.)*

---

## Visualization
The project includes a visualization comparing actual vs. predicted gold prices:
- A line plot was created using `matplotlib` to display actual gold prices (blue dashed line) and predicted gold prices (orange solid line).
- The plot includes labels, a title, a legend, and a grid for better readability.

---

## Dependencies
The project requires the following Python libraries:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`

These can be installed using the `requirements.txt` file:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Creating `requirements.txt`
To create a `requirements.txt` file, run the following command in your Python environment:
```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```
Ensure the above libraries are included in the file.

### How to Use This on GitHub:

1. **Create the `README.md` File**:
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on the "Add file" button (or "Create new file" if it's a new repository).
   - Name the file `README.md`.
   - Copy the entire block of code above and paste it into the editor.
   - Click "Commit new file" to save it.

2. **Customize Placeholders**:
   - Replace `<repository-url>` in the "Installation" section with the actual URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/gold-price-prediction`).
   - If you have specific evaluation metrics (MAE, MSE, R²) from your model, update the "Results" section with those values to make the README more informative.

3. **Add Supporting Files**:
   - Ensure your repository includes the Jupyter notebook (`gold_price_prediction.ipynb`) and the dataset (`gld_price_data.csv`) in the appropriate directory structure.
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file by running the command provided in the "Dependencies" section, or manually create it with the following content:
     ```
     numpy
     pandas
     matplotlib
     seaborn
     scikit-learn
     ```
   - If you choose a specific license (e.g., MIT), add a `LICENSE` file to your repository with the appropriate license text.

4. **Enhance the README (Optional)**:
   - If you extend the project (e.g., by adding hyperparameter tuning, feature engineering, or additional visualizations), update the README to reflect these changes.
   - Consider adding screenshots or GIFs of the visualizations to make the README more engaging. You can upload images to your repository and reference them in the README using Markdown syntax, e.g., `![Visualization](path/to/image.png)`.
