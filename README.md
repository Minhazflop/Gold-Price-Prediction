# Gold Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project predicts gold prices using a **Random Forest Regressor**. It takes historical data, preprocesses it, and trains a machine-learning model to estimate future gold prices.

## 📂 Dataset
- The dataset contains gold price data with various influencing factors.
- Ensure that `gld_price_data.csv` is placed in the correct directory.

## 🛠 Installation
### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/gold-price-prediction.git
   cd gold-price-prediction
```
### **2. Install Dependencies**
```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to train and test the model:
```sh
   jupyter notebook Gold Price Prediction.ipynb
```

## 🔎 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing & Visualization  
✅ Train-Test Split & Model Training  
✅ Prediction & Performance Evaluation  
✅ Matplotlib Graphs for Visualization  

## 📊 Model Used
- **Random Forest Regressor** from `sklearn.ensemble`
- Performance is evaluated using Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), etc.

## 📈 Results & Analysis
- The model's predictions are compared against actual prices.
- The visualization plots help assess the accuracy.
